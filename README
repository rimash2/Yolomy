## IP-WEEK-7 - Containerization with Docker-Project Description
In this project we will use a Dockerfile and Docker-compose to build and run the containers to make the web app runs on our browser.
Build a basic microservice to run the app.
The application is an e-commerce website that doubles-up as a dashboard where you can load retail products on to the site.
